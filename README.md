# DNPERF
## Official clients and DX11 only.
> - Tested on SEA. 

## Disclaimer
**Use at your own risk, especially getting banned or losing your raids.** I haven't fully tested this on raids, only tested in towns and PVP 8v8.

## List of changes
- Port some functions of d3dx9math to DXMATH (compiled with AVX)
- Ice stacks attach only once.
> - (Damage is still the same, ~~but I might find an alternative without affecting the visuals. Currently found a workaround and implementing it as soon as possible)~~. Will be sticking with "attach only once". It still frame drops with the other workaround.
- Removed a lot of Critical Sections.
- Increased FPS on 8man (raid) or 8v8 PVP repsawn
- Removed equipment score for less stuttery when browsing/comparing equipments
- Port zlib to zlib-ng (with runtime check to use SSE/AVX/AVX2/AVX512 etc)
- Decrease loading at startup by 6-10s or more depends on the system
- Faster C libraries with SIMD (runtime check to use SSE/AVX)
- Fixed memory leak
- Removed FXAA
- Removed restore audio
- Fix misaligned particles (Works on DX9).

## Upcoming releases
- Use vcruntime140 for AVX2 memcpy/memset

## List of did not fix (might be a TODO)
- Micro-stutters/stutters (most likely heap related or reading files that blocks the thread)
- Better frametime
- Find and fix memory leak
